The opening and expanding of subway lines in the City of Toronto was a direct result of an increasing Canadian population in the 1950s. As Canada’s largest and most populated city, Toronto experienced rather novel and unique effects of this national population boom. Most notably, suburbanization and inner-city developments created a necessity for a new and expanding transit infrastructure within the city.

Canada’s population has fluctuated dramatically over the past century. The most notable instance of this fluctuation was in 1951, when the annual number of landed immigrants in Canada jumped from 73,912 to 194,391 ([Statistics Canada](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-516-x/sectiona/A350-eng.csv)). These figures were likely results of changes to federal immigration laws that were discriminatory against people originating from other countries. In 1950, the Government of Canada lifted the immigration restriction on citizens from former wartime “enemy” countries such as Germany and Italy ([Toronto.ca](https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/history-art-culture/museums/virtual-exhibits/history-of-toronto/the-modern-metropolis-from-1951/)). In the 1960s, restrictions against visible minorities and citizens of “third world” countries began to shift. In tandem with the increasing immigration rate that began in the 1950s, the number of foreign-born Canadians was also steadily increasing ([Toronto.ca](https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/history-art-culture/museums/virtual-exhibits/history-of-toronto/the-modern-metropolis-from-1951/)). Between 1951 and 1961, approximately 784,000 Canadians were born ([Statistics Canada - Megatrends](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-630-x/11-630-x2016006-eng.htm)). This increase of population directly influenced the City of Toronto and helped establish it as the present-day cornerstone of Canadian multiculturalism.

The City of Toronto experienced suburbanization (a large movement of people into new suburban areas from the city), population growth, and also a notable increase in the number of automobiles in the early 1950s. According to the 1951 census of Toronto, 69 percent of the peoples were foreign-born Canadians and 27 percent were not ethnically British. After 1951, the diversity of the city began to shift, and waves of immigration flowed into the city ([Toronto.ca](https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/history-art-culture/museums/virtual-exhibits/history-of-toronto/the-modern-metropolis-from-1951/)). In 1953, the Province of Ontario implemented a two-tiered civic structure separating Metropolitan Toronto from the City of Toronto itself. The Metropolitan designation consisted of rural jurisdictions such as Scarborough, North York, Etobicoke and York ([Toronto.ca](https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/history-art-culture/museums/virtual-exhibits/history-of-toronto/the-modern-metropolis-from-1951/)). These spatial changes reflect the type of development that was occurring in, around, and beyond Toronto, such as suburban housing and an expanding business sector. These types of developments were also consequences of the city’s population growth at the time.

Suburbanization divided the rural areas from the urban areas, as well as the business sector from the residential sector. Population growth and the introduction of automobiles resulted in a type of traffic that the City of Toronto was unfamiliar with at the time. Commuting thus became an important problem to continuously tackle since the 1950’s.
The Toronto Transportation Commision, now known as the Toronto Transit Commission, made significant strides to tackle the congestion within the city. They created new bus routes, and improved existing surface routes of trolleys (the earliest form of streetcars) and streetcars. However, the most notable change was the introduction of subway lines ([Toronto.ca](https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/history-art-culture/museums/virtual-exhibits/history-of-toronto/the-modern-metropolis-from-1951/)). The Yonge line was the city’s first subway line, opened in 1954, and ran from Union to Eglinton ([Transit Toronto](https://transit.toronto.on.ca/subway/5100.shtml)).

The introduction of the Yonge subway line immediately eased the congestive inner city traffic, and replaced the Yonge streetcar line that was established in 1861 ([Transit Toronto](https://transit.toronto.on.ca/subway/5102.shtml)). The Yonge subway line positively changed the efficiency of transportation within the city, and made a lasting impact. This is evident from the further expansion of the Yonge subway line past Eglinton to Finch, where it is today, continuing to match the city’s always-changing urban-rural dynamic. Prior to the opening of the Yonge line, the postwar baby boom caused a demand for affordable housing. Presented with this new demand, suburban development therefore commenced in 1952 in Don Mills ([Toronto.ca](https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/history-art-culture/museums/virtual-exhibits/history-of-toronto/the-modern-metropolis-from-1951/)). Similarly to our current condominium revolution, suburban dwellings dominated the housing markets. The slow outward migration of inner city residents resulted in rising demand for transportation so that residents could commute to and from the city. The development of suburban housing in Don Mills and the migration of inner city residents is reflected in the expansion of the Yonge line from Eglinton to York Mills in 1973, and York Mills to Finch in 1974 ([Transit Toronto](https://transit.toronto.on.ca/subway/5100.shtml)).

The University line was introduced in 1963, running from Union to St.George, and the Bloor line was opened in 1966, running from Keele to Woodbine ([Transit Toronto](https://transit.toronto.on.ca/subway/5100.shtml)). Each one of these lines ran from the heart of the bustling downtown core - where the majority of businesses were located - to the outer residential areas of Toronto. However, none of these lines at the time accommodated for Metropolitan Toronto areas such as Scarborough and Etobicoke. After the Second World War, automobiles allowed for low-density developments away from major streetcar routes ([Toronto.ca](https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/history-art-culture/museums/virtual-exhibits/history-of-toronto/the-modern-metropolis-from-1951/)). Outer city residents increasingly invested in automobiles for commuting to and from the city, which resulted in higher density traffic. This type of change prompted extensions on the initial lines, notably the Bloor West line extending from Keele to Islington in 1968, the Danforth East line extending that same year, and the Spadina line extending from St. George to Wilson in 1978.
