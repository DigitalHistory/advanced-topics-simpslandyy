## Introduction
Nichelle Nichols encounter with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr revealed the importance of racial representation and the influence it carried to bring forth social change in the mid 1960’s. Nichelle Nichols was creating a space and painting a new image of what it meant to be black in America through her role as Nyota Uhura in Star Trek. She was enforcing change at a time where there was resistance to change.


## Star Trek - The Franchise
Star Trek, created and produced by Gene Roddenberry, is a popular science fiction television series that debuted in the mid 1960’s. The Star Trek franchise is a conglomerate that attracts a diverse fan base and is arguably a liberal-humanist project. In Science Fiction Audiences (1995), Henry Jenkins comments that the themes such as feminism, multiculturalism, and gay rights are commitments that fans have made because of the Star Trek philosophy [^zero]. Nichelle Nichols, an African American actress, acted as Nyota Uhura during the course of the original series from 1966 to 1969 [^first]. The show imagined a distance time and world absent of racism, sexism and capitalism (Daniel Bernardi, 210).


## The Civil Rights Movement
Although slavery was abolished after the Civil War in America, tensions between races was far from resolved. Jim Crow laws established in the late 19th century immobilized African Americans from sharing public spaces, such as restrooms, libraries, and educational institutions. The laws revoked voting rights from African Americans and deemed interracial marriage illegal. Discrimination, prejudice, and violence against African Americans became a norm and the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s and 1960’s marked the road to end inequality and see forth a social change [^second].


## Nichelle Nichols Representation
Nichelle Nichols “first-love” of musical theater came back to haunt her during her Star Trek career and pushed her to the point of almost quitting. It was not until a special Star Trek fan encounter that she reconsidered her choice. “I turn and instead of a fan there's this face the world knows with this beautiful smile on it. And I remember thinking, whoever that fan is, is gonna have to wait because Dr. King, Dr. Martin Luther King -my leader- is mo- walking towards me not 10 feet away with a beautiful smile on his face. And then this man says, 'Yes Ms. Nichols I am that fan. I am your best fan, your greatest fan.'” <a href=javascript:seek(13) onclick="javascript:seek(13)"> (13 seconds) </a> Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was the face of the Civil Rights Movement. He established a following that not only consisted of African Americans but of all races [^third].

“For the first time on television we will be seen as we should be seen everyday.”<a href=javascript:seek(197) onclick="javascript:seek(197)"> (3:17 seconds) </a> Nichols was completely unaware the significance of her role and the influence she had on network television. She was not characterized as a "standard" African American on television. Nichols continues to paraphrase Dr. King Jr, “As intelligent, quality, beautiful people who can sing, dance and -but can go to into space. Who can lawyers, who can be teachers, who can profes- who are in this day, and yet you don’t see it until now.”<a href=javascript:seek(205) onclick="javascript:seek(205)"> (3:25 seconds) </a> The statement uncovers the problem with network television in the 1960s and the kind of standard that African Americans were held to. Daniel Bernardi states that the delivery of race during the 1960's through entertainment was foreign to network television [^fourth]. Bernardi argues that African Americans and even Native Americans were characterized as "either shiftless and unintelligent or as obedient servants to white men". Some television examples are Amos' N Andy (1951-1953) and The Lone Ranger (1949-1957) [^fourth]. Network television was divided by race and there wasn't a space where people of all races could come together. Bernardi also acknowledges this, he states that Asian, Latinos, and Native Americans were absent from television and network programs segregated African American television as "race-shows" [^fourth]. Nichols role in Star Trek, as well as some of her other colleagues, was providing a space for the world to see a different kind of representation of people of minority.

“Your role is not a black role and it’s not a female role, he can fill it with anything including ... an alien”<a href=javascript:seek(264) onclick="javascript:seek(264)"> (4:24 seconds) </a>
Nichols role was replaceable and anyone could fill the slot, however Gene Roddenberry choose Nichols for a reason. Bernardi argues that Star Trek attempts to push a liberal-humanist ideology but engages with a liberal paradox. This paradox informs conscious activities such as writing, the decision making process, and the directing of Star Trek [^fourth]. Therefore, Gene Roddenberry and even NBC, the network that aired Star Trek, had an agenda that was mindful of the different movements such as the civil rights movement and the anti-war movement [^fourth]. Although Nichols fit perfectly into the slot for which the agenda could be fulfilled, she wasn't the only person who could fill the slot. The story of Star Trek could be spun in many different ways so that anyone could fill her slot as long as the agenda was being met, including an alien. Nichols' role was necessary to engage in a conversation of racial-equality.

Nichols’ role was necessary to engage in a conversation of racial-equality. Leaving Star Trek at that critical time would revert the African American representation on network television to where it was before. It was important that Nichols continued to disarrange the standard of African American peoples by being an equal role to the white man. In a later part of Nichols oral account, she talks about meeting with Gene Roddenberry to discuss staying in Star Trek. “& I said Gene, and I told him what had happened, and I said, if you still want me to stay I’ll stay, I have to and he opened his drawer and he looked up at me and said, ‘God Bless, Martin Luther King. Somebody knows where I’m coming from.’”[^fifth] The vision that Dr. King Jr tried to explain to Nichols was the same vision Gene Roddenberry had for the show. This oral account supports the argument that there was a conscious attempt to push an agenda into homes across America, specifically an agenda that supports the civil rights movement. Nichols played an important role to ensure that agenda was met.
